## type safe, testable, but also fun ##

Dawn has 3 core parts - an [injector](http://wiki.github.com/sammyt/dawn/dawninjections) with a full feature set, here is a taste:

*   constructor, method and property injection
*   terse DRY configuration via actionscript DSL
*   named, instance and factory providers for lots of flexibility
*   built in and custom scopes
*   eagerSingleton scope for early object creation
*   post construction callbacks

A [notification](http://wiki.github.com/sammyt/dawn/dawnnotifications) system designed to leverage the inbuilt type system of the language and a [command](http://wiki.github.com/sammyt/dawn/dawncommands) library built on top of the injector and notifier for types safe injectable commands

Check out the [documentation](http://wiki.github.com/sammyt/dawn "wiki").  Then there is also the 
[presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/sammyt/dawn-actionscript-library-2563556) I gave
at [FLUG](http://www.meetup.com/flexlondon/calendar/11793506/?from=list&offset=0) and I churn out the odd [blog post](http://www.ziazoo.co.uk)

I've just created a [forum](http://www.dawn-lib.org) for Dawn.  There Isn't a lot there, but feel free to ask if you want any help or have some thoughts :)
